## Introduction:

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is consistently increasing, and one of the most challenging aspects is the transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric ones. The difficulties rise due to the struggle to provide affordable charging infrastructure. In the state of New Jersey, many utility companies, like Public Service Electric and Gas (PSEG) and Atlantic City Electric (ACE), are starting to offer rebates and incentives for the purpose of installing EV charging stations in various counties to maintain widespread accessibility (Qmerit, 2024). As of 2021, PSEG and ACE are now accessible for the purpose of reducing financial struggles of the public in today’s society.

The average cost of installing an EV charging station at home is around \$500 to \$2,000 but can also be on the higher end (\$5000+). There can also be other costs for other upgrades that are needed. PSEG offers \$1,500 for an installation of a Level 2 charging station and a \$5,000 discount for utility-side make-ready costs. ACE covers up to \$5000 or 75% of the installation cost for an EV charger. Rebates function in a way where there is an amount of reimbursement for some of the installation costs. This lowers the expenses that residents have to pay when they put their stations in place.

Our research is important to society because New Jersey contains a high urban environment (New Jersey’s Clean Energy program, 2020). The high urban environment has dense populations as well as more chances of traffic, so this reduces any greenhouse gasses that are exerted.These charging station rebates lead to clean transportation choices and offer awareness to the public about the importance of positive EV consumption (US Department of Transportation, 2023). This research used to promote residents to understand the relationship between rebates and EV adoption helps New Jersey’s objectives to reducing greenhouse gasses and promoting healthy energy uses.

## Existing Research:

Electric vehicle (EV) charging rebates are financial incentives that are given by governments and certain organizations to encourage people to acquire electric vehicles. When one applies for a rebate after purchasing an EV charging station, one can receive some money back. This helps promote cleaner transportation options and makes charging stations more affordable and convenient. Due to that factor, energy companies have created EV charging station rebate programs to help incentivize people to buy EVs. Our study will build on existing findings and delve deeper into the impact of utility companies' charging station rebates on electric vehicle adoption. Despite there being some research done on similar topics, there are noticeable gaps. Certain studies have focused on border areas from a geographical standpoint, or also lack specific information on the impact of rebates on EV adoption rates in New Jersey. Muehlegger & Rapson (2022) studied EV adoption in California and helped strengthen our data when focusing on New Jersey by using reliable comparisons (Muehlegger & Rapson, 2022). The state of California gives a broader perspective of the subsidies and purchases of EVs from another geographic location. Clinton & Steinberg (2019) explained the relationship between financial incentives and EV adoption through its lessons (Clinton & Steinberg, 2019). Their quantitative research focused on the effects of BEV policy adoption in predominantly Massachusetts, California, and Texas. Their findings indicated incentives offered as state income tax credits do not have a statistically significant effect on BEV adoptions, though they cautioned it may be a result of limited changes in BEV incentives over time in the sample used. Our study will address those gaps due to focusing strictly on New Jersey and its direct impact of the rebates on EV adoption. We will also focus on a time period where we can directly see the impact of the rebates in order to offer a proper comparison between having the rebates and not having the rebates. 

## Data Description:

### Outcome Variable:

-   The outcome variable is Vehicle.Count (EV sales) in the zip codes in New Jersey. This measures the number of electric vehicles registered, which serves as a proxy for EV adoption in response to the treatment (rebate programs).

### Treatment Variable:

-   The treatment variable is the rebate programs offered by the utility companies (ACE_Rebate, PSEG_Rebate). These rebates are intended to encourage the installation of EV charging stations, which, in turn, could increase EV adoption.

-   **PSEG:** Electric Vehicle Charging Program which was implemented on June 15, 2021, offers \$1,500 for Level 2 EVSE make-ready infrastructure. \$5,000 discount for utility-side make-ready costs.

-   **Atlantic City Electric:** Residential Charger Rebate Program implemented on February 17, 2021, rebate up to 75% of electrical upgrade costs – or a maximum of \$5,000 – for installing an EV charger at home. In overburdened communities, 100% of the cost is covered.

### Frequency/Geographic Unit:

-   Frequency: The dataset is semi-annual, with observations collected every six months from 2016 to 2023. The EV sales data was taken from: <https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/state-ev-registration-data/>

-   Geographic Unit: The data is organized by zip code.

### Treated and Untreated Group:

-   Treated Group: Zip codes served by utility companies that provide rebates before the first half of 2022, specifically ACE and PSEG.

-   Untreated Group: Zip codes served by utility companies that do not provide rebates before the first half of 2022, specifically Rockland Electric Company (REC) and JCP&L (Jersey Central Power & Light).

Step 1: Show the initial dataframe

```{r}
df<-read.csv("panel (1).csv") %>%
  rename(ACE_Rebate = AEC_Rebate, ACE = AEC)
```

```{r}
kable(head(df))
```

Step 2: Create a plot to visualize the distribution of the outcome variable under treatment and no treatment.

```{r}
#| warning: false
df2 <- df %>%
  mutate(Registration.Date = as.Date(Registration.Date)) %>%
  filter(Registration.Date < as.Date("2022-06-01")) %>%
  group_by(Registration.Date, NAME, ACE_Rebate, PSEG_Rebate, ACE, PSEG) %>%
  summarize(Total_EV = sum(Vehicle.Count))

JCPLandPSEG <- df2 %>%

summary(model4)
```

## Preliminary Regression Results:

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(df)

#df2 <- df %>%
 # mutate(Registration.Date = as.Date(Registration.Date)) %>%
  #filter(Registration.Date < as.Date("2022-06-01")) 

```

```{r}
df4 <- df2 %>%
  filter(NAME == "Jersey Central Power & Light" | NAME == "Public Service Electric & Gas Co.")
  
model1 <- felm(Total_EV ~ PSEG*PSEG_Rebate, data=df4)
summary(model1)

df5 <- df2 %>%

```

## Question 1: What is the predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=0?

Answer: 1078 EVs for the zip codes covered by REC and ACE, 8819 EVs for the zip codes covered by PSEG and JCP&L,

## Question 2: What is predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=1?

Answer: ACE: 1078 + 644 + 1210 + 1183 = 4115. This number includes EVs for the ACE and REC region.

PSEG: 8819 + 5950 + 12009 + 7524 = 34302. This number includes EVs for the PSEG and JCP&L region.

## Question 3: What is the equation that describes the linear regression above? Please include an explanation of the variables and subscripts. $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ACE_C + \beta_2 ACERebate_T + \beta_3 ACE_C*ACERebate_T + \beta_4  + \beta_5 PSEG_C + \beta_6 PSEGRebate_T + \beta_7 PSEG_C*PSEGRebate_T $$

y represents the expected amount of vehicle sales in the zip codes covered by ACE and PSEG in New Jersey. C represents company and T represents the rebate time. When calculating the impact on PSEG treated areas, the ACE values are 0 and viceversa.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, we examined four electricity companies, Public Service Electric & Gas (PSEG), Atlantic City Electric (ACE), Rockland Electric Company (REC), and Jersey City Electric and Power (JCPL), in the state of New Jersey to see how their rebate programs implemented the adoption of electric vehicles. To be more specific, we compared ACE to REC and JCPL to PSEG, as the pairs had similar trends in the number of EVs in zipcodes covered by them.

Starting with ACE and REC, the ACE rebate was implemented in 2021 before REC's in 2022, so we decided to compare the increase in EVs caused by the ACE rebate. After running the model, we found our intercept to be 1078, which would've been the amount of EV sales in REC's region per 6 months without any rebates, and the number of EVs in ACE's region to be 1078 + 644 = 1722. Now, with the ACE rebate, the model predicted the number of EV sales to in ACE's region to grow to 1078 + 644 + 1210 + 1183 = 4115, while the number of EV's in REC's region to grow to 1078 + 1209 = 2287. **Thus the impact of the ACE rebate is around 4115 - 2287 = 1828 EVs.**

Continuing with PSEG and JCP&L, the PSEG rebate was also implemented in 2021 before JCP&L's in 2022, so we decided to compare the increase in EVs caused by the PSEG rebate. After running the model, we found our intercept to be 8819, which would've been the amount of EV sales in JCP&L's region per 6 months without any rebates, and the number of EVs in PSEG's region to be 8819 + 5950 = 14, 769 before its rebate was implemented. Then, once the PSEG rebate was implemented, the model predicted the number of EV sales in PSEG's region to grow to 8819 + 5950 + 12009 + 7524 = 34302 EVs while the number of EV's in JCP&L's region to grow to 8819 + 12009 = 20828 EVs. **Thus the impact of the PSEG rebate is around 34302 - 20828 = 13474 EVs.**

Although there is a positive correlation between the rebate and EV sales, we cannot fully determine if rebates were the main reason the EV sales increased or if there were other factors that played a part. **The results we got from the models are not statistically significant**, so we would need more data in order to fully answer the question. However, from our research and the data we had, **we were able to confirm a positive correlation between rebates and EV sales in New Jersey.**

## Future Plans:

Our future plans include a more detailed analysis taking other variables into account. For example, we could look at electricity costs in different seasons to see if that impacts the perceived benefit of EV charging station rebates. We also want to collect more data so we can have more conclusive results and determine if there is more of a causation between rebates and EV sales in New Jersey. We also plan to look at other states and rebate policies based on the data available. This would help us compare our preliminary results of New Jersey to other states to see if trends are similar.
