## Introduction:

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is consistently increasing, and one of the most challenging aspects is the transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric ones. The difficulties rise due to the struggle to provide affordable charging infrastructure. In the state of New Jersey, many utility companies, like Public Service Electric and Gas (PSEG) and Atlantic City Electric (ACE), are starting to offer rebates and incentives for the purpose of installing EV charging stations in various counties to maintain widespread accessibility (Qmerit, 2024). As of 2021, PSEG and ACE are now accessible for the purpose of reducing financial struggles of the public in today’s society.

To install an EV charging station at home, the cost can vary from \$500 to \$2,000. There can also be other costs for any other upgrades that are needed. PSEG offers \$1,500 for an installation of a Level 2 charging station and a \$5,000 discount for utility-side make-ready costs. ACE covers up to \$5000 or 75% of the installation cost for an EV charger. Rebates function in a way where there is an amount of reimbursement for some of the installation costs. This lowers the expenses that residents have to pay when they put their stations in place.

Our research is important to society because New Jersey contains a high urban environment (New Jersey’s cleanenergy program, 2020). The high urban environment has dense populations as well as more chances of traffic, so this reduces any greenhouse gasses that are exerted.These charging station rebates lead to clean transportation choices and offer awareness to the public about the importance of positive EV consumption (US Department of Transportation, 2023). This research used to promote residents to understand the relationship between rebates and EV adoption helps New Jersey’s objectives to reducing greenhouse gasses and promoting healthy energy uses.

## Existing Research:

Electric vehicle (EV) charging rebates are financial incentives that are given by governments and certain organizations to encourage people to acquire electric vehicles. When one applies for a rebate after purchasing an EV charging station, one can receive some money back. This helps promote cleaner transportation options and makes charging stations more affordable and convenient.This study will build on existing findings and delve deeper into the impact of utility companies' charging station rebates on electric vehicle adoption. Despite there being some research done on similar topics, there are noticeable gaps. Certain studies have focused on border areas from a geographical standpoint, or also lack specific information on the impact of rebates on EV adoption rates in New Jersey. Other studies also may not have researched consumer behavior, accessibility affordability, and rebate mechanisms overall. Muehlegger & Rapson (2022) studied EV adoption in California and helped strengthen our data when focusing on New Jersey by using reliable comparisons (Muehlegger & Rapson, 2022). The state of California gives a broader perspective of what the subsidies and purchases of EVs are from another geographic location. Clinton & Steinberg (2019) explained the relationship between financial incentives and EV adoption through its lessons (Clinton & Steinberg, 2019). Our study will address those gaps due to focusing strictly on New Jersey and its direct impact of the rebates on EV adoption.

## Data Description:

### Outcome Variable:

-   The outcome variable is Vehicle.Count (EV sales) in the zip codes in New Jersey. This measures the number of electric vehicles registered, which serves as a proxy for EV adoption in response to the treatment (rebate programs).

### Treatment Variable:

-   The treatment variable is the rebate programs offered by the utility companies (AEC_Rebate, PSEG_Rebate). These rebates are intended to encourage the installation of EV charging stations, which, in turn, could increase EV adoption.

-   **PSEG:**  Electric Vehicle Charging Program which was implemented on June 15, 2021, offers \$1,500 for Level 2 EVSE make-ready infrastructure. \$5,000 discount for utility-side make-ready costs.

-   **Atlantic City Electric:** Residential Charger Rebate Program implemented on February 17, 2021, rebate up to 75% of electrical upgrade costs – or a maximum of \$5,000 – for installing an EV charger at home. In overburdened communities, 100% of the cost is covered.

### Frequency/Geographic Unit:

-   Frequency: The dataset is semi-annual, with observations collected every six months from 2016 to 2023.

-   Geographic Unit: The data is organized by zip code.

### Treated and Untreated Group:

-   Treated Group: Zip codes served by utility companies that provide rebates before the first half of 2022, specifically AEC and PSEG.

-   Untreated Group: Zip codes served by utility companies that do not provide rebates before the first half of 2022, specifically OR (Rockland Electric Company) and JCP&L (Jersey Central Power & Light).

### Data Cleaning and Analysis:

```{r}
#| echo: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("kableExtra")
install.packages("lfe")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library("tidyverse")
library("kableExtra")
library("lfe")
```

Step 1: Show the initial dataframe

```{r}
df<-read.csv("panel (1).csv")
```

```{r}
kable(head(df))
```

Step 2: Create a plot to visualize the distribution of the outcome variable under treatment and no treatment.

```{r}
#| warning: false
df2 <- df %>%
  mutate(Registration.Date = as.Date(Registration.Date)) %>%
  filter(Registration.Date < as.Date("2022-06-01")) %>%
  group_by(Registration.Date, NAME, AEC_Rebate, PSEG_Rebate, AEC, PSEG) %>%
  summarize(Total_EV = sum(Vehicle.Count))

JCPLandPSEG <- df2 %>%
  filter(NAME == "Public Service Electric & Gas Co." |
         NAME == "Jersey Central Power & Light")

ACEandREC <- df2 %>%
  filter(NAME == "Atlantic City Electric" | 
         NAME == "Rockland Electric Company")

ggplot(JCPLandPSEG, aes(x = Registration.Date, y = Total_EV, color = NAME)) + geom_line() + geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2021-06-15"), linetype = "dashed") + theme(legend.position = c(0.3, 0.8)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Public Service Electric & Gas Co." = "purple", 
  "Jersey Central Power & Light" = "cyan4")) +
  labs(y="Total EV Sales", x="Date", color = "Utility Companies")

ggplot(ACEandREC, aes(x = Registration.Date, y = Total_EV, color = NAME)) + geom_line() + geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2021-02-01"), linetype = "dashed") + theme(legend.position = c(0.3, 0.8)) + scale_color_manual(values = c("Atlantic City Electric" = "purple", 
  "Rockland Electric Company" = "cyan4")) +
  labs(y="Total EV Sales", x="Date", color = "Utility Companies")
 

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(df2, aes(x = Registration.Date, y = Total_EV, color = NAME)) + geom_line()

model1<-lm(Total_EV ~ AEC*AEC_Rebate + PSEG*PSEG_Rebate, data=df2)
summary(model1)
```

## Preliminary Regression Results:

Step 8: Fit a regression model $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ where $y$ is the outcome variable and $x$ is the treatment variable. Use the **summary** function to display the results.

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(df)

#df2 <- df %>%
 # mutate(Registration.Date = as.Date(Registration.Date)) %>%
  #filter(Registration.Date < as.Date("2022-06-01")) 

```

## Question 1: What is the predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=0?

Answer: 36 EV sales per zip code per 6 months

## Question 2: What is predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=1?

Answer: AEC = 28(decreased), PSEG = 103(increased)

## Question 3: What is the equation that describes the linear regression above? Please include an explanation of the variables and subscripts.

Answer: $$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 AEC + \beta_2 AECRebate + \beta_3 AEC*AECRebate + \beta_4  + \beta_5 PSEG + \beta_6 PSEGRebate + \beta_7 PSEG*PSEGRebate
$$

y represents the expected amount of vehicle sales in the zip codes covered by AEC and PSEG in New Jersey

```{r}
df4 <- df2 %>%
  filter(NAME == "Jersey Central Power & Light" | NAME == "Public Service Electric & Gas Co.")
  
model3 <- felm(Total_EV ~ PSEG*PSEG_Rebate, data=df4)
summary(model3)

df5 <- df2 %>%
  filter (NAME == "Atlantic City Electric" | NAME == "Rockland Electric Company")

model4 <- felm(Total_EV ~ AEC*AEC_Rebate, data=df5)
summary(model4)

```

## Conclusion:

Our future plans include a more detailed analysis taking other varia

## Future Plans:

Our future plans include a more detailed analysis taking other variables into account. For example, we could look at electricity costs in different seasons to see if that impacts the perceived benefit of EV charging station rebates. We also plan to look at other states and rebate policies based on the data available. This would help us compare our preliminary results of New Jersey to other states to see if trends are similar.
